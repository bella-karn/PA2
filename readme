run with following commands 
gcc -o task1 task1.c -pthread
./task1 server 127.0.0.1 12345
./task1 client 127.0.0.1 12345 10 10
//for normal ^^
./task1 client 127.0.0.1 12345 500 10
//for overload ^^

With that many clients it should display some packets lost

gcc -o task2 task2.c -pthread
./task2 server 127.0.0.1 12345
./task2 client 127.0.0.1 12345 10 10
//for normal ^^
./task2 client 127.0.0.1 12345 500 10
//for overload ^^

Then you can see when ran with this command all of the packets sent are all the packets recieved 

The additional two files were original versions of task2 for trying to figure out how to solve the problem, I wanted to keep them in the submission so I could look back
on what might have went wrong in them!
